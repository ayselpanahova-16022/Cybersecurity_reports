# 👋 Hello, I'm Aysel Panahova

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently exploring **Cybersecurity Fundamentals** as part of my Spring 2025 coursework. Here, you’ll find a curated collection of my learning progress, hands-on labs, and CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges — from dissecting packet traffic to uncovering hidden flags in disguised files.

---

## 🕵️ Forensics & Investigations
- Extracted files from disk images using Sleuthkit — even deep within inode layers
- Correlated IP conflicts and MAC addresses to identify malicious actors
- Discovered flags hidden in metadata, cookies, and misleading file extensions

---

## 🌐 Network Traffic Analysis
- Captured and analyzed HTTP/TCP packets using **Wireshark**
- Measured response times, identified parallel downloads, decoded data from payloads
- Filtered meaningful packets based on payload size and protocol behavior

---

## 🔐 Web Security & CTF Challenges
- Revealed hidden credentials by analyzing JavaScript, CSS, and HTML source code
- Manipulated browser cookies to bypass user restrictions and access admin content
- Solved puzzles involving ROT13, Base64, and renamed files

---

## 🧩 Puzzle Solving & Cryptography
- Cracked substitution ciphers and hidden messages
- Used `grep`, `cat`, and other CLI tools to extract secrets from large datasets

---

## ✍️ Recent Writeups & Highlights
- **Bookmarklet Flag Finder** – Used JavaScript in browser bookmarks to reveal a hidden flag  
- **Authorization Code Decryption** – Solved a cipher using letter frequency analysis  
- **Disguised Files** – Found hidden flags in mislabeled PDFs that were actually PNGs  
- **Cookie Exploit** – Bypassed admin restrictions by flipping a boolean value  
- **Wireshark Inspection** – Extracted credentials from plain-text HTTP POST traffic  
- **Disk Image Analysis** – Explored raw disk sectors to locate embedded text clues

Stay tuned as I continue to expand my skills and share more technical challenges, tools, and discoveries!
